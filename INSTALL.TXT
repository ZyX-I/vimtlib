* Install from GIT

** runtimepath

The easiest way would be to check out the repository and append the path 
to your local copy to ''runtimepath''. You could then still disable 
certain plugins, by setting the variable ''loaded_{PLUGIN_NAME}'' in 
your vimrc file.


** vimballs

In the vimballs, subdirectory you'll find recipes for building vimballs. 
You could then install those vimballs wherever you want. But ... those 
recipes assume you have already installed the plugins. =8-O

As an alternative, the ruby script ruby/vimball.rb can be used to create 
and install vimballs without vim.
