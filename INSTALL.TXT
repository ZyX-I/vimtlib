* Install from GIT

This repository includes several plugins. I am well aware that this is bad practice. Anyway, here are a few suggestions of how to make use of this repository:


** Modify the ''runtimepath''

Add a local copy of it to 'runtimepath':

#Code <<
set runtimepath+={PATH TO YOU LOCAL COPY}/vimtlib

Plugins like Marc Weber's vim-plugin-manager or Tim Pope's pathogen could be of help here.

If you choose this option, you will by default load all plugins---even those you don't care about. You can disable specific plugins by setting loaded_* variables in your vimrc file.

If you have GNU make available, run ''make -f Makefile_vimfiles loaded'', which will generate a file ''macros/vimtlib.vim''. Add ''runtime macros/vimtlib.vim'' to your ''vimrc' file and ''unlet'' all those ''loaded_*'' variables that refer to those plugins you want to load.

Example: Load only the tlib, tskeleton, and viki plugins

#Code <<
runtime macros/vimtlib.vim
TLibUse tlib tskeleton viki


** Use symbolic links

Symlink the files to your vimfiles directory. You could use tools like graft for this.


** Build vimballs

Vimball recipes for the following plugins are located in the vimballs subdirectory.

In the ruby subdirectory, there is a ruby-based script that help automating this process. If you have ruby installed, type ''...vimtlib/ruby/vimball.rb -h'' to find out which command-line options to use. Re-generate all vimballs with ''make -f Makefile_vimtlib VIMTLIB=... vba''.
