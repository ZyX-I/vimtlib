* Install from GIT

** runtimepath

The easiest way would be to check out the repository and append the path 
to your local copy to ''runtimepath''. You can always disable plugins 
by setting the variable ''loaded_{PLUGIN_NAME}'' in your vimrc file.


** vimballs

The vimballs subdirectory contains recipes for building vimballs. You 
might want to add the vimtlib as an extra basedir argument to 
'':MkVimball''.

Alternatively, the ruby script ruby/vimball.rb can be used to create 
and install vimballs without vim.

Build all vimballs:
''ruby/vimball.rb -z -d vimballs vba vimballs/*.recipe''

Not recomended but if you insist:
Install a vimball (check the values of ''helptags'' and ''vimfiles'' in 
advance, see ''vimball.rb --print-config''):
''ruby/vimball.rb install vimballs/VIMBALL ...''
