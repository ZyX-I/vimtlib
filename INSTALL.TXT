* Install from GIT

This repository includes several plugins. I am well aware that this is 
bad practice. Anyway, here are a few suggestions of how to make use of 
this repository:


** Modify the ''runtimepath''

Add the path to the local copy to 'runtimepath':

#Code <<
set runtimepath+={PATH TO YOU LOCAL COPY}/vimtlib

You have the following options to facilitate doing this:


#1
Plugins like Marc Weber's vim-plugin-manager or Tim Pope's pathogen 
could be of help here.


#2
If you choose this option, you will by default load all plugins---even 
those you don't care about. You can disable specific plugins by setting 
loaded_* variables in your vimrc file.

If you have GNU make available, run ''make -f Makefile_vimfiles 
loaded'', which will generate a file ''macros/vimtlib.vim''. Then add 
''runtime macros/vimtlib.vim'' to your ''vimrc' file and ''unlet'' all 
those ''loaded_*'' variables that refer to those plugins you want to 
load.

Example: Load only the tlib, tskeleton, and viki plugins

#Code <<
runtime macros/vimtlib.vim
TLibUse tlib tskeleton viki


#3
vimtlib includes a script macros/tplugin.vim that help managing the 
runtimepath. This script also allows users to use only certain plugins 
from the vimtlib repository.

See doc/tplugin.txt for details.



** Use symbolic links

Symlink the files to your vimfiles directory. You could use tools like 
graft for this.


** Build vimballs

Vimball recipes for the following plugins are located in the vimballs 
subdirectory.

In the ruby subdirectory, there is a ruby-based script that helps 
automating this process. If you have ruby installed, type 
''...vimtlib/ruby/vimball.rb -h'' to find out which command-line options 
to use. Re-generate all vimballs with ''make -f Makefile_vimtlib 
VIMTLIB=... vba''.
