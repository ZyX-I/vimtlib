*tbak.txt*              Yet another backup plugin that uses diff

Description~

                                                    *:TBak*
:TBak[!]
    Make a backup of the current buffer in '.attic/DATE/'.
    
    If [!] is given, backups are saved in a global repository (default: 
    '$HOME/.attic/DATE/DIRS/FILE'). The name global is slightly 
    misleading though, as you can use the buffer-local variable 
    b:tbakGlobalDir to set the destination directory per buffer.

    If a buffer already exists for the formatted date, a diff is 
    created. The full backup in the backup directory is the newest 
    version of the file. I.e. if you want version t-5, you'd have to 
    patch this file with the 5 latest diffs.


The following commands are somewhat experimental:

                                                    *:TBakRevert*
:TBakRevert[!] [version]
    Revert to an earlier version of the file.
    If [!] is given, work on the global repository.

                                                    *:TBakView*
:TBakView[!] [version]
    Display a diff with an earlier version of the file.
    If [!] is given, work on the global repository.

                                                    *:TBakCleanup*
:TBakCleanup[!] [maxversion]
    Remove obsolete versions.
    If [!] is given, work on the global repository.
    ATTENTION: This works on all backups in the backup directory.


Configuration~

                                                    *g:tbakDateFormat*
g:tbakDateFormat    string (default: '%y%m%d')
    This variable defines how often full backups are made. The default 
    value is good for daily full backups. Other possible values are: 
    '%y%m' for monthly and '%y%W' for weekly full backups. This variable 
    can be overridden by the buffer local variable b:tbakDateFormat.

                                                    *g:tbakDiff'
g:tbakDiff          string (default: 'diff -u3 "%s" "%s" > "%s"')
    The command to create patches.
    The command is issued in the backup directory.

                                                    *g:tbakCheck*
g:tbakCheck         string (default: 'diff -q "%s" "%s"')
    The command to check if two files differ.
    The command is issued in the backup directory.

                                                    *g:tbakAutoUpdate*
g:tbakAutoUpdate    boolean (default: 1)
    If true, automatically update/save modifed buffers before making the 
    backup.

                                                    *g:tbakAutoBackup*
g:tbakAutoBackup    boolean (default: 0)
    If true, automatically make backups on every save. This variable 
    can be overridden by the buffer local variable b:tbakAutoBackup.

                                                    *g:tbakGlobal*
g:tbakGlobal        boolean (default: 0)
    If true, make global backups. This variable can be overridden by the 
    buffer local variable b:tbakGlobal. For global backups, the 
    directory structure is rebuilt.

                                                    *g:tbakGlobalDir*
g:tbakGlobalDir     string (default: '')
    The directory where to make global backups. Default is $HOME. This 
    variable can be overridden by the buffer local variable 
    b:tbakGlobalDir.

                                                    *g:tbakDir*
g:tbakDir           string (default: '')
    Where to make the backup directory. Default is expand("%:p:h"). This 
    variable can be overridden by the buffer local variable b:tbakDir.

                                                    *g:tbakAttic*
g:tbakAttic         string (default: '.attic')
    The name of the subdirectory.
